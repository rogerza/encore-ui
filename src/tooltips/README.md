[![unstable](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/unstable.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

This component provides styles and a demo for the [the Angular-UI Bootstrap Tooltip plugin](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/tree/master/src/tabs), which is included as a dependency for Encore-UI.

Note that the `tooltip` directive and its optional attributes can *only* be applied to raw HTML elements. They can't be applied to directives like this: `<rx-button tooltip="...">`

If you're creating your own custom directive, it's fine to use the `tooltip` directive inside of your directive's template.

## Usage

Usage is the exact same as demoed on the Angular-UI Bootstrap site. See [the Angular-UI Bootstrap Docs](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) for further guidance on usage and configuration of this component.
